        "ai_response": "The term \"paranormal\" refers to phenomena that are believed to be beyond the scope of natural law and explanation, often involving supernatural or spiritual elements. Paranormal beliefs and experiences include things like ghosts, psychic abilities, UFOs, and cryptids (animals whose existence or survival is uncertain or unsubstantiated).\n\nParanormal investigators and researchers use various methods to try to collect evidence of these phenomena, such as electronic voice phenomena (EVPs), infrared thermometers, and dowsing rods. However, many paranormal claims are not supported by scientific evidence and are often met with skepticism and criticism from the scientific community.\n\nIt's important to note that while there may be some unexplained phenomena, many paranormal claims can be explained by natural causes or human trickery. As with any belief system, it's important to approach paranormal claims with a critical and open-minded perspective, and to be skeptical of any claims that lack solid evidence."
